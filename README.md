# Introduction

M# is a pioneering project that showcases the full range of features and functionalities that a REST web API should possess.

The project will focus more on the API it's self, Rather than the database.

The project will feature robust support for the essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, enabling seamless interaction with the database and efficient management of data.

## Features & Functionalities

The API will include the following features and functionalities:

1. Authentication: The API should support secure authentication to protect sensitive data.

2. Authorization: The API should enforce access controls to limit access to specific users, roles, and resources.

3. Request/Response: The API should accept HTTP requests, process them, and send back HTTP responses.

4. Data Formats: The API should support common data formats like JSON, XML, or YAML.

5. Documentation: The API should have comprehensive documentation that explains how to use it, including sample requests and responses.

6. Error Handling: The API should provide meaningful error messages that can help developers debug issues.

7. Versioning: The API should support versioning to allow for changes without breaking existing client applications.

8. Scalability: The API should be able to handle a large number of requests, potentially scaling up or down based on demand.

9. Performance: The API should be fast and efficient, responding to requests in a timely manner.

10. Security: The API should be secure, protecting sensitive data and ensuring that only authorized users can access it.

# Getting Started

using the .NET CLI Tool:

```bash
  cd path/to/project
  dotnet restore
```
- `dotnet restore` - Restores the dependencies and tools of a project - `MyProject.csproj`.

Run with:

```bash
  cd path/to/project
  dotnet run
```

# Testing

You can test the API using:

- Swagger / OpenAPI.

Recommended tool: **Postman**

- **Postman** is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIsâ€”faster.
